# `f` - shell navigation of projects with git worktrees

This is a clone of [h](https://github.com/zimbatm/h) with slight modifications to accomodate git worktrees and learn rust ☺️


## Usage

`f <name>` - navigates to the repo and master/main branch

`f <owner>/<repo>`

`f <url>`


### Flags

`-b <branch_name>` - use in conjunction of other commands to specify a branch to checkout, create, and navigate to.
